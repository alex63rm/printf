This folder contains the submitted items. You can check the grades in the main ReadMe.

MyComments:
In this folder I have commented important things that helped me to understand
the project. Hope you find them useful too!

In this project we will learn about variadic functions

va_start, which initializes the list, 
va_arg, which returns the next argument in the list, 
va_end, which cleans up the variable argument list.

Logic approach of this project
1. start reading the string until you find a % character
2. When the % character is found, we have to determine the type of the variable of the next char
3. We have to do 2 things: First, write the characters. Second, count them to return the total lenght- printf returns an int
